What an amazing experience! This was my first time completing a web app with the rails framework. It is both powerful and relatively easy to use. It provides default structures for a database and web pages. It also facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. Rails also emphasizes the use of other welll-known software engineering patterns, including convention over configuration (CoC), dont repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.

Through seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development, its really no surprise that Rails is a favorite in the web development community. A relatively inexperienced developer (like myself) can be up and running with a working, scalable, web application in just a few hours. Amazing! The framework also lends itself well to large enterprises, in production at companies such as: Airbnb, GitHub, Bloomberg, and Shopify.

I was able to create a workout scheduling app, that takes into account your competitive goals. Users are able to record workouts, competitions, and training sessions. As well as access other user training information as a benchmark for progress. I love to exercise, and have recently been thinking about signing up for an endurance event of some kind. I thought it might be helpful to have an app track my progress. Rails made it very easy to set up and make several changes to my database, and include multiple interesting functions. Such as the ability login with your Google credentials, which felt trully useful and therefore very satisfying.

I had a blast learning Ruby and Rails, and cannot wait for the next chapter: JavaScript. Making innovative and responsive front-ends to go with my light-yet-robust back-end. Looking forward to creating cooler stuff!
