     I have always been interested in technology. It's exciting to see new gadgets and apps that are innovative. I have always been fascinated by not only what I could do with new technology, or how much more convenient it would make my life but how it worked. For some reason I had always thought that it was out of reach for me. The people around me would also share my enthusiasm for technology, but would always reverberate how difficult it is to break in to the tech industry, especially if you "can't do math." So I had to break out of some pretty heavy mental barriers just to get to a point where I believe that I can achieve this goal of being a software engineer.
		 
		 The next thing I had to do was to try to code on my own. I used several online free code courses to get my feet wet. It was extremely frustrating, but very satisfying. But it also brought something else to light, I needed structure. I began looking in to getting a computer science degree and enrolled in my local community college's CS program. The experience of my first class that involved coding (in python) was exhilarating. It showed me just how BIG the programming world was and how many things I could build with code. I was hooked!
		 
		 Until then I had never enrolled in college, and was quite adamant about not going. It was an idiological stance I was taking against acquiring debt for something I felt should be free universally. This meant that I had never had a job that required any true skills. I am able to lift 50 lbs over my head and can do basic arithmetic, and that is basically what my resume consisted of. Learning to code and having a blueprint of how to learn in general has opened up a new world for me. Being a software engineer would not only be extremely satisfying, but it's an opportunity to grow every single day. What could be better than spending your day figuring out problems, collaborating with other smart people and building amazing products? For me, absolutely nothing.
		 
		 I am so excited for the opportunity Flatiron School has given me. Although I am still enrolled in college full-time, because Flatiron School's curriculum is so specific and teaches technologies that large companies and start-ups use every day, I will be able to find a job much sooner than had I waited to get my bachelors degree. I am able to switch careers from a community manager at a flexible office space company to a software engineer in less than a year, and I honestly can not believe that it's actually happening. This is a dream come true.
