I've just completed my module 4 project, which includes a JavaScript front-end. This was a truly humbling experience. I found JavaScript to be very vast and agreeable, as well as an incredibly detailed language. I look forward to learning more about it and trying some new things out on a future project. 

I also created a Ruby on Rails RESTful API. It was simple, just a few models and actions hooked up to a PostgreSQL database. I made a discussion forum app about video games. It was also my first time working with PostgreSQL, and it works pretty much the same as SQLite, however SQLite is not deployable. So the experience is great because I will be able to deploy future projects. I also had a chance to learn to use a serializer. One of my favorite things to do is adjust its attributes to see how it would affect the JSON output. 

It was so interesting to understand how information was going back and forth between my front end and API. Until now I had only understood this concept in theory, and this was a chance to create the flow of information. It was very exciting. 

I cannot wait to begin my next and final module where Iâ€™ll be learning the popular framework: React. It will be great to get ideas for all the things I can create while learning.
