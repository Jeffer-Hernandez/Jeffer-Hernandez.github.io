Learning about Sinatra was such an interesting experience. To come out on the other side of "learning the basics" is truly rewarding. Sinatra gives you the tools to harness all of the nitty gritty aspects of programming in an organized and succinct way. It's beautiful! This was my first time writing a program using a framework of any kind and it really fired me up about future projects. Now that the very crucial, foundational knowledge is well chunked in my mind I'm free to use powerful tools to create amazing things.

I made a simple app that has users sign up and review cigars. They would create a profile, complete with a photo and bio. The user would also be able to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own reviews at any time, as well as read fellow smoker's reviews. This was a great tutorial for how a larger or more complex app may be created, perhaps using other frameworks or even languages. I'm excited to see what the rest of my journey has in store.
